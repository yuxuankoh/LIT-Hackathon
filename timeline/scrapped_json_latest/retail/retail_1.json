These restrictions will not apply to medical and dental consultations that require patients to have their masks removed.)\n\n(e.\tSince 15 July 2021, it has been mandatory for establishments providing personal care services (e.g. facial and nail services, spas/saunas, massage establishments, hairdressing, and make-up services) to place all employees on a regular Fast and Easy Testing (FET) regime using tests such as antigen rapid test (ART), regardless of their vaccination status.)\n\n<ul>\n  <li>This includes both part-time and full-time employees, as well as third-party contracted staff (e.g. cleaners) who work at the establishments.

Such regular FET will continue to be made free of charge during this period.</li>\n</ul>\n","start":["22 July","22 July"],"end":["18 August 2021"],"day_of":[]},{"question":"How can supermarket manage queues now that the measures may result in more people buying groceries to cook at home?","answer":"(Supermarket retailers should implement other crowd management measures (e.g. limiting the number of shoppers within the store at any one time) to ensure that one metre spacing can be maintained between shoppers.
